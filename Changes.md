# What's new? (05/08/2024)

- ## Added a React web app where implementing

  - **Machine learning models**
  - **Scripts for tasks automation**

  The React web app is still on development.

# Errors or something? (05/08/2024)

Yeah, some of the neural networks has problems to predict trigonometry functions values, it doesn't even predict 30% the ``sin(x)`` to ``cos(x)``. i'll try to fix it using other neural network type.

> NOTE FROM AUTHOR:

> I notice that it's so ambiguous to train the machine to predict trigonometric values. I'll not implementing that long


# What's new? (24/08/2024)

- ## Added ``Ligthbulb`` folder

``Lightbulb`` was add as a resource to improve code drafts before implementing it in ``Tests``. 

As developer, you can add your own draft file with the extension ``.ipynb``.

- ## Changed `Next.js` instead `React` framework
